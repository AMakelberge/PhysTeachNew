Stuff for the n-body problem page:

- [ ] Buttons to pause the simulation

- [ ] Click on the screen and it gives you the info of the closest planet
    - [ ] Change the variable of the planet from this screen

- [ ] Drag and drop a new planet onto the screen and give it initial value

- [ ] Have some interesting presets
    - [ ] Comet between 2 stars
    - [ ] Binary system
    - [ ] Earth and Moon
    - [ ] Sun and Earth
    - [ ] Sun, Earth, and Moon
    - [ ] Black holes, getting sucked into it
    - [ ] A near miss of an asteroid hitting earth

- [ ] Click on a planet and let you move it around

- [ ] Make all the files separated and clean

- [ ] Add paths that you can toggle on and off of where the planets have been

- [ ] Make the OOP proper with getters and setters

- [ ] Be able to delete objects
